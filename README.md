# Insurance-Claim-Analysis-Demographic-and-Health
Notebook Overview In this notebook, we will take a closer look at Insurance Claims and figure out some facts about how conditions such as blood pressure, BMI, diabetes, smoking, age, and gender impact the claim value.

We will touch the topics through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using scatter plots, pie charts, histograms etc.

Later we build models, and evaluate them.

Finally, we make predictions, and gauge the predicted figures.
